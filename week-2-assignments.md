# Week 2 - Assignments

1.**Watch videos at:** [**https://git-scm.com/videos**](https://git-scm.com/videos)

**Install git scm software & configure for first time \(see reference:** [**https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) **but my recommendations are:** 

* **Install Git \[Use the gitforwindows project for windows -** [**https://gitforwindows.org/**](https://gitforwindows.org/)**; using** [**https://git-scm.com/download/mac**](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) **for Mac with directions explained here - including security issues -** [**https://codeburst.io/installing-git-for-the-first-time-on-mac-osx-bf9c513af2b8**](https://codeburst.io/installing-git-for-the-first-time-on-mac-osx-bf9c513af2b8)**\]**

**1a. Send me a copy or a screenshot of your .gitconfig file via email or  \(.gitconfig is a “hidden file” - in Windows, probably will be at C:\Users\yourusername\.gitconfig; in Mac, will likely be at /Users/yourname**

**1b. note any challenges you had with installation / .gitconfig finding \(e.g., in Gitter Week 2 room, or post directly to me\)**

**2. fork the ccsute350 repo coursedocs \(if you didn’t already\)**

**2a. clone the coursedocs repo to your local repository, work from your clone of the forked repo**

**2b. edit the syllabus.md** 

 **2c. for basic points, simply add your name at the bottom of the page**

 **2d. for 2-5 extra points \(pending the1.6 Getting Started - First-Time Git Setup number and legitimacy of edits\), also find a typo, misspelling, need for updated url, or other mistake, then fix it, and send a pull request to me\) Read: Getting Legit with Git and GitHub: Your First Pull Request** [**https://thenewstack.io/getting-legit-with-git-and-github-your-first-pull-request/**](https://thenewstack.io/getting-legit-with-git-and-github-your-first-pull-request/)

**3. Practice with git - add another Repo to your GitHub, work with it in git & commit locally & to your remote GitHub repo** 

* **try forking, then cloning down a git repository -** [**https://github.com/ccsu-te350/Week2-Class-1**](https://github.com/ccsu-te350/Week2-Class-1)
  * **fork the repo on github to your own github account**
  * **go into command line git, get to root directory you want your repo to be in -  e.g., C:/Users/yourusername**
  * **then git clone your forked repo with the address provided by github - e.g., git clone https://github.com/myusername/Week2-Class-1.git** 
  * **git status**
  * **then, into that local repo, add a file called readme.md \(put in it whatever you want, e.g., \# This is my readme.md file for the Week2-Class-1 repository\)**
  * **go through the git add \[staging\] option**
  * **git commit & then git push edits back up \[before git push, check the git remote -v, reset if needed, see below about cloning down another person’s repo\]**
  * **try cloning down someone else’s repo, e.g., git clone** [**https://github.com/epodigital/Git-and-GitHub-for-Poets.git**](https://github.com/epodigital/Git-and-GitHub-for-Poets.git)

   **when you git remote -v**

   **you should see that your remote is to the original person’s repo; you won’t be able to push to this, so the remote will need to be reset?**

   **create your empty repo at github to be the remote for your cloned version of the repo**

    **copy the empty repo’s address then:** 

**git remote set-url origin** [**https://github.com/youraccountname/yournewemptygitrepo.git**](https://github.com/youraccountname/yournewemptygitrepo.git)

   **only then can you git push origin master**  


**Read from** _**Pro Git**_ **\(free online, openly licensed at** [**https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)**\) - at least:** 

* **1.3 Getting Started: What is Git?**
* **In SUPPORT OF 1a - Read** _**Pro Git**_**'s 1.6 Getting Started - First-Time Git Setup:** [**https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) **\[don’t worry about editor default, but do set up your user.name and user.email\]** 

**In preparation for the next class about use of Pull Requests in Open Source Software:**

* Listen to \(approx. 26 m\) podcast **Command Line Heroes Podcast, SEASON 2, EPISODE 3: “Ready to Commit” \[00:26:15\]**
